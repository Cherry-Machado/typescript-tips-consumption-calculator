# Overview

I am a Software Developer trying expand my learning in programming.

This is a Tip and Consumption Calculator program coded in TypeScript, React as a Frontend framework and Tailwinds CSS for styling.

The program was created to demonstrate my skills in Typescript. I create a Form and used the array structure to build the program.
